<h1>Welcome to CareShare!</h1>

We are a Caregiver community, helping people find local caregivers for their parents<br>
<br>
We have the following policies:
<ul>
<li>You must register to use this service to find a local caregiver.</li>
<li>We use Care Dollars as a virtual currency in this community.</li>
<li>When you offer care service, you receive payment in Care Dollars, which is added to your CareShare account. You may use your accumulated Care Dollars to hire caregivers for your own parents.</li>
<li>You must have enough Care Dollars to hire a caregiver, in accordance with your mutually agreed upon contract (the standard rate is 30 Care Dollars per hour).</li>
<li>Each contract is for multiple weeks and must specify start/end dates, and daily working hours per week. You are responsible for your own scheduling to avoid conflicts.</li>
<li>Signing up grants you a bonus 2000 Care Dollars to get you started!</li>
